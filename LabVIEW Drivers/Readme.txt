LabVIEW Drivers for AMI Magnet Systems
Version 6.0
12 Dec 2018

The included drivers are designed to operate with LabVIEW version
8.2.1 or higher, and require a LabVIEW-supported serial interface 
or an Ethernet interface.

The virtual instruments (VI) should be compatible with LabVIEW 
installations on other operating systems, however this is not 
presently tested.

The "example" VI's illustrate one way to use the lower level VI's
for each instrument in an integrated control panel. The user may
customize the examples or develop a custom panel to perform the
specific actions required by an experiment.

The VI's are self-documenting. You can discover details about the
exact function of the VI by exploring the contents of each.

Model 430 Connection Options:
--------------------------------
The VIs provide two options for interfacing a host
computer to the AMI Model 430 Power Supply Programmer.

The Model 430 can be directly connected to the host computer
via either Ethernet (TCP/IP), which is preferred, or RS-232.
Static IP address assignment is recommended for the Model 430
in order to avoid the DHCP server from assigning different
IP addresses the the same instrument over time.
